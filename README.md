Create a two tier Client Server Architecture (using Tomcat & JSP or SOAP/REST Services) and apply encryption & decryption services.
1.	As part of client, send a text string to server.
2.	On the Server (tomcat),  concatenate timestamp to the text string (send from client) and encrypt using “AES” algorithm
3.	Send the Encrypted Cipher to the client and display it.
